picochat is a simple chat program written to demonstrate p8modem.

To run the server (on port 8888), do this:
  $ python3 -m pip install websockets
  $ python3 picochat_server.py

To deploy the client-side PICO-8 program, load `picochat.p8` into
your PICO-8, then follow the steps in `README.md` in the root
directory of this git repository, under the "PICO-8 Developer
Guide" section.
